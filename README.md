Single-C-File (Kshaa fork)
=============

This is a fork of [Adrian Dawid's dwd31415/single-c-file](https://github.com/dwd31415/single-c-file).  

Three changes were introduced:
- Support the merged output filename to be provided as an argument
- Support inclusion of relative path files
- Support for `define`, `ifndef` & `endif`

Note: This code has no guarantees of working.
